# godot-dynamic-crosshair
Drawing of a crosshair that has recoil

TODO:

1. [done] Crosshair is a circle
2. [done] Its radius increases when "shoot", cooldown to get back to normal size
3. [done] simplify deg to rad, keep all in radians, less computation
4. [tood] make a plugin out of it

In-game TODO:

1. [todo] Its radius is a function of the distance to the object aimed at
2. [todo] recoil that pushes up / shakes the camera
